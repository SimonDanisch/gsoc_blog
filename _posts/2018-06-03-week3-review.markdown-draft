Week 3 of GSoC is **done**! ðŸ˜ŽðŸ¤ 

The last two weeks were packed with lots of learning, programming, and of course debugging (including what is possibly the most embarassing programming mistake of my life :sweat_smile:[^footnote1]).

I am also happy to announce that I will be attending [JuliaCon 2018](http://juliacon.org/2018/)! This will take place during Aug. 7â€“11, 2018 at University College London. For a student like me, this shall be a great opportunity for learning from the best minds, seeing what else is possible with Julia, and networking. Also, it would be great to visit London :wink:.

The following is a short progress report of the past two weeks' work.


#### Finished
* docuementation of function signatures from [`Plots.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl).
* documentation of the argiment conversion functions in [`argument_conversion.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl/blob/aw/documentation/src/argument_conversion.jl).
* further extension of the help functions, `help`, `help_arguments`, and `help_attributes` to be more detailed and robust, and to handle more input types.
* extension of the help functions to print to a specified `io` stream (if unspecified -> `STDOUT`). This is useful to redirect the output to a file, for example (see later).
	* external `help` function prints as Markdown-parsed text
	* internal `_help` function prints plaintext
* implement `find_indices` and `example_database` functions which accept `input_tags` as the input and has optional keyword arguments `author` and `title` to further filter the results.
	* `find_indices` searches the example database for examples matching the input tags, and returns the indices. 
	* `example_database` returns the entries associated with the input tags and prints the source to the REPL by overloading `Base.show` on the `CellEntry` type.

		```julia
		#code snippet in nested bullet
		```

* rewrite docstrings for plotting atomics functions
* automatically generate an overview Docs page of all plotting atomics functions in `Makie.jl` including their function signatures and attributes
* automatically generate an Docs page (examples gallery) of all examples sorted and cross-referenced by `tag`, including example code and generated plots (plots currently not workingâ€”see TODOs section).
	* implement an internal `_print_source` function that prints the source code of the plot example, including specifying the code flavor in a fenced block (e.g. "\`\`\`julia")
* pushed four commits related to the above, [](), [](), [](), [](), [](), []().
* one merged pull request for refactoring [\(PR #89\)](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl/pull/89)
* met with mentor five times in total (including today).


#### TODOs
* one of next week's first TODOs is to...

	```julia
	#more code
	```
* automatically generate a detailed Docs page of all plotting atomics functions, including some plot examples and the source code for the plots
	* the source code embedding is working, but plotting is not working yet due to non-functioning backend. This should hopefully be resolved soon.
	* using `Documenter.jl`'s `Selectors.Matcher` and `Selectors.Runner` to match and select specific plot examples from the examples database (for example by matching the specific example's title).

#### Difficulties encountered
* the backend for the plotting hasn't been fully implemented yet, as a result I cannot do the plot export + embed in the documentation pages yet. But hopefully this will be available soon!

So, that's it for today's post! Onwards to the next week!
