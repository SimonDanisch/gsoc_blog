The following is a short progress report of the past two week's work.

#### Finished -- `Makie.jl` and `AbstractPlotting.jl`
* found one bug in `ImageMagick.jl` regarding exporting of binaries to the system `PATH` and filed an issue ([#120](https://github.com/JuliaIO/ImageMagick.jl/issues/120))
* manually tested the plot examples from the [examples library](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl/blob/aw/documentation/examples/library.jl), fixed some examples, and documented & temporarily disabled the non-working ones (big thanks to Simon for his assistance on this)
* added auto-parsing and generation of documentation pages for atomic plotting functions
* overloading `Base.show` for displaying examples database entries of the type `CellEntry`
* added `_print_source` function and the ability to print different flavours of code blocks (e.g. \`\`\``julia`) using keyword arguments `julia`, `example`, `eval`. 
	* when printing in `example` flavour, automatically number the examples. This also respects when examples are grouped (e.g. in example plots with multiple steps, this should show plotting examples after each step)
* auto-generation and saving of static plots and animated plots (as video)
* added the auto-generation of thumbnails from static plots and animated plots, in doing this, found the bug in `ImageMagick.jl` as shown above
* with the backend implemented, added auto-generation of plot gallery page showing all examples, with the ability to handle grouped examples
* general code refactoring
* updated some various documentation and docstrings
* pushed commits related to the above, [24035c3](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl/commit/24035c3df63fb7943bfa4a0d784233f9489f59de), [89a0c9c](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl/commit/89a0c9c5a8c63fcf616f46392b5958482200851a), [1fc822e](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl/commit/1fc822e305ff9f363267be6a753f1ce58c88a332), [ac986be](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl/commit/ac986bea8a794a5b9097af3f34674412b9d3f95f), [daa3e01](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl/commit/daa3e01a557085c1ca0485f48fa26d0665ad2a7f), [e95be0b](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl/commit/e95be0baad0651155e166741511b3e0ed1d42434), [4c2cdf0](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl/commit/4c2cdf092d8f9154cb84d427fdd322eeea582b4e), [62fa378](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl/commit/62fa378e627b8b7acc7e7aab22dd8b53b1aec45d), [e386361](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/AbstractPlotting.jl/commit/e386361aedf64bb7dea4e28ac1d492087733ddcc), [8555289](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/AbstractPlotting.jl/commit/8555289510da4701e0c2ec240e89a2f35d6c848c), [82bfaa1](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/AbstractPlotting.jl/commit/82bfaa199b43b4196d2a93a055a18944867bcc0b), [74db7aa](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl/commit/74db7aa3e8b7c2089f42a068e95372bd4642e3f3), [450c976](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl/commit/450c9766d25b043200603efb35d01628a0b73d1c), [b284012](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl/commit/b2840125f3d53595c5377b93e4ed2e8223f14390), and [ede0f82](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl/commit/ede0f82aba4c9d2e524c947b727f0236a19cdbe3).
* met with mentor four times in total.
* made my [first plot example](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl/commit/450c9766d25b043200603efb35d01628a0b73d1c)! :)

#### TODOs
Some of next week's TODOs are:
* add polish to the documentation generation code & general code cleanup
* more documentation changes


#### Difficulties encountered
* package resolution difficulties during updating packages have caused numerous headaches of different severity and duration... this problem is compounded since I had sent in my laptop for repair so had to use the old desktop PC during this time
* difficulties in tracing `Documenter.jl`'s building errors during documentation generation, and finding where the error occurs


So, that's it! Hope you enjoyed reading this (or at least watching the fancy videoüòÅ). Fingers crossed for Evaluation 1ü§û & onwards to the next weeks!
