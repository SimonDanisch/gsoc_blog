Hello! :)

This is my first blog post. I'm excited to announce that I have been selected by [NumFOCUS](https://www.numfocus.org/) to work as a [GSoC 2018](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) student!

I will be working with the [Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang) team, more specifically on extending the documentation and documentation capabilities of [`Makie.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl).

My mentor is [Simon Danisch](https://github.com/SimonDanisch/). I'm excited to be working together with an expert! :)

Stay tuned for more developments!
