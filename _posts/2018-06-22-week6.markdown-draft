Week 6 of GSoC is **done**! ü§ìüíª <sub><sup>And I guess I survived Evaluation 1 and am still here... ‚úåÔ∏èüòÖ</sup></sub>

The following is a short progress report of the past week's work.

#### Milestones
* [`Makie` documentation released online!](https://makie.juliaplots.org/latest/)
* [`Makie` legacy release!](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl/releases/tag/v0.0.1)
* [`AbstractPlotting` prelease!](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/AbstractPlotting.jl/releases/tag/v0.0.1)


#### Finished -- `Makie.jl` and `AbstractPlotting.jl`
* one commit merged to `master` branch at `AbstractPlotting.jl` ([a6e3c72](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/AbstractPlotting.jl/commit/a6e3c725758b1fbd1343198e93971944892bcfec))
* improved thumbnail generation vastly (reducing aliasing artifacts) by first Gaussian filtering the image ([7290e18](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl/pull/98/commits/7290e189c80971fa44c2189191a848200c55d651))


#### TODOs
* two major pull request in progress for merging to `master`! ([#98](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl/pull/98) and [#93](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl/pull/93))


#### Difficulties encountered
* due to issues in `Documenter.jl`, the thumbnails in `Makie`'s documentation cannot be as nicely cross-referenced as I'd like. I am thinking of alternative ways to manually cross-reference the thumbnails, but have no elegant solutions so far. I have discussed this with [@mortenpi](https://github.com/mortenpi) on Slack, and filed three issues regarding this:
	* [`Makie.jl` issue #95](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl/issues/95)
	* [`Documenter.jl` issue #744](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl/issues/744)
	* [`Documenter.jl` issue #745](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl/issues/745)


So, that's it! Hope you enjoyed reading this. Onwards to the next weeks üë®‚Äçüíª!
